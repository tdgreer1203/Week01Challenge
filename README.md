# Week01Challenge
 Challenge for week 1 of bootcamp. 

 The goal of this challenge is to refactor the existing code to make it more accessible, easier to read, and better structured. I intend to perform the following actions in this order:

 1. Analyze the structure of the site to see if any changes can be made.
 2. Based on the structure of the code, identify any changes that can be done in the css.
 3. Add comments throughout as needed.
 4. Add accessibility to the site. 

What I actually did:
1. At first glance, I could see there was a lot of duplicate code in the style.css file. I refactored that code to reduce the number of classes used.
2. Updated the html with the newly created css elements. Also found the opportunity to replace some of the <div> with some semantic html elements.
3. Then went back and adjusted the css file even more.
4. Added alt attribute to all image tags.
